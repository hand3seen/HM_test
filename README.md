Headmosh Zine Lab

Permission to create — right in the browser. Make a one‑sheet, 8‑page mini‑zine with drag‑and‑drop images, bold black‑and‑white assets, prompts, scribbles, and an automatic print layout.

✨ Features

8 editable panels — click to type; paste or drag images directly into a panel.

B/W Asset Library — dozens of bold, printable SVG objects (waves, starburst, checkers, tape roll, scissors, arrows, headphones, bubbles, etc.). Drag into panels or click Add random B/W object.

Shuffle — remix panel order instantly.

Optical background — double‑click a panel to toggle a triangle illusion pattern.

Scribble overlay — add grainy hand‑drawn energy with one click (and clear it).

Save/Load — export your project to JSON (images are saved as data URLs) and load it later.

Export PNG — capture the current 8‑panel workspace.

Zine Layout → Print — auto‑imposes panels to a front/back sheet you can print and fold into a mini‑zine.

Imposition order: Front: 8 • 1 • 2 • 7 — Back: 6 • 3 • 4 • 5
